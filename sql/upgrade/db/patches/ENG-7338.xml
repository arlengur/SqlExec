        <comment>Update the "One premutation 55-90 CGG and one premutation 91-200 CGG" scenario for FMR1.

            `clinicalDetails` = 'Two premutation size ${(results[0].cggRepeats[0])!"cgg1"} and ${(results[0].cggRepeats[1])!"cgg2"} CGG repeat alleles were detected in the FMR1 gene. Female premutation carriers have an increased risk for Fragile X associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) and a late-onset neurological condition called Fragile X associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS). Occasionally, females with a premutation may have issues related to attention span such as Attention Deficit Disorder and some may have behavior problems, social anxiety, and/or difficulty with social skills. Comprehensive genetic counseling and additional medical workup as clinically indicated should be considered. This individual is at increased risk to have a child with Fragile X Syndrome. AGG testing through Asuragen Laboratories will be performed and a separate report will be sent. This report will refine the chance for expansion of the CGG repeat tract.'
